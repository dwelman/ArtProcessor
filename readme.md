# What is this?
This is a script I wrote to process my artworks. I draw on paper and then scan it into my computer, after which I need to open it in GIMP and save multiple copies. It's exhausting

The script is simple, and can be run with no arguments to see how to use it.

This is very specific to my own use cases, but feel free to use this in whatever way you need.
